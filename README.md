# SampleRepository
This is a Sample Repository hosted on Github.
This Repository contains a python script that proves the Collatz Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture says that any number, if following a certain set of rules will always lead to one. Eventually.

The rules are as follows:
  If the number is even, devide it by two
  
  If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one.
